Judgement of Energy DIstribution
=============================

JEDI is a quantum chemical strain analysis tool working with the Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE).
This is the version used for the paper "JEDI: A versatile code for strain analysis of molecular and periodic systems under deformation". The package will not be updated in this repository. If you want the latest version go to https://neudecker-group.github.io/jedi/ for the maintained repository


Requirements
------------

* Python_ 3.8 or later
* NumPy_ (base N-dimensional array package)
* ase_ 3.23 (functions to determine atomic structures' geometries and quantum chemical calculators)




Installation
------------

Add ``~/jedi`` to your $PYTHONPATH environment variable
